# PhotoPrism and Portainer Setup Script

This repository provides a complete script for setting up the PhotoPrism stack, which includes:
- **PhotoPrism**: A powerful photo management application.
- **MariaDB**: A database to store PhotoPrism data.
- **Nginx**: A reverse proxy with automatically generated self-signed SSL certificates.
- **Portainer** (optional): A user-friendly Docker container management interface.
- **Backup Automation**: Automates backups for the MariaDB database with configurable retention.

The script is designed to work seamlessly on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** (via Docker Desktop and Git Bash).

## Overview

This script automates the deployment of a PhotoPrism stack. It sets up all required components, including MariaDB, Nginx, SSL certificates, and optional Portainer. The script is interactive and allows full customization based on user inputs.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed:

1. **Docker**: Required to run containers.
   - **Linux**: Install using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install docker.io`).
   - **macOS**: Install using Homebrew (`brew install --cask docker`).
   - **Windows**: Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Docker Compose**: Required for orchestrating containers.
   - **Linux**: Install using `sudo apt install docker-compose`.
   - **macOS & Windows**: Included with Docker Desktop.

3. **OpenSSL**: Required for generating SSL certificates.
   - **Linux**: Install using `sudo apt install openssl`.
   - **macOS**: Install using Homebrew (`brew install openssl`).
   - **Windows**: Install using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install openssl`).

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmacri/PhotoPrismCustomizedSetup.git
cd PhotoPrismCustomizedSetup
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
bash setup_photoprism_customizeme.sh
```

### Step 3: Follow the Prompts

The script will prompt you for:
- **Docker network name**: Default is `photoprism_network`.
- **Paths for storage and originals**: Provide full paths to existing directories.
- **Admin credentials**: Specify username and password for PhotoPrism.
- **Local IP or domain**: Used for Nginx and SSL generation.
- **Portainer inclusion**: Choose whether to include Portainer in the setup.

---

## Features

1. **Self-Signed SSL Certificates**:
   - Automatically generated for the provided domain or IP.
   - Ensures secure access to PhotoPrism and Portainer.

2. **Dynamic Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Automatically creates a `docker-compose.yml` file tailored to your inputs.

3. **Backup Automation**:
   - A script (`backup_photoprism.sh`) automates MariaDB backups with a default retention of 7 days.

4. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via Git Bash).

---

## Customization Prompts

### Example Inputs
1. **Docker Network Name**: Enter `my_docker_network` or press Enter for the default (`photoprism_network`).
2. **Storage Directory Path**: Provide the full path to a directory where PhotoPrism will store its data, e.g., `/home/user/photos/storage`.
3. **Originals Directory Path**: Provide the full path to a directory containing your original photos, e.g., `/home/user/photos/originals`.
4. **Local IP or Domain**: Enter `192.168.1.100` (for local use) or a domain like `photos.example.com`.
5. **Include Portainer**: Type `yes` to include Portainer or `no` to skip it.

## Generated Outputs

### Folder Structure
After running the script, the following structure is created:

```
photoprism-setup/
├── config/
│   ├── photoprism.env
│   ├── ssl/
│       ├── photoprism.crt
│       ├── photoprism.key
│       ├── openssl-san.cnf
├── scripts/
│   └── backup_photoprism.sh
├── docker-compose.yml
├── setup_photoprism_public.sh
└── setup_photoprism.log
```

### Key Files
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines Docker services.
- **`photoprism.env`**: Environment variables for PhotoPrism.
- **`ssl/`**: Contains SSL certificates.
- **`backup_photoprism.sh`**: Automates MariaDB backups.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Docker Not Running**:
   - Ensure Docker Desktop or the Docker service is running before executing the script.

2. **Invalid Paths**:
   - Verify that the storage and originals directories exist.

3. **SSL Certificate Errors**:
   - Ensure OpenSSL is installed and accessible.

4. **Portainer Not Accessible**:
   - Verify that Docker is exposing Portainer on port `9000`.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Change Default Passwords**:
   - Update the default MariaDB password in `photoprism.env`.

2. **Secure Secrets**:
   - Avoid storing secrets directly in `.env`. Use a secret manager for production.

3. **SSL Certificates**:
   - Self-signed certificates are suitable for internal use. Use a trusted CA for production environments.
